## Description ##

The Cookie Law is one of the most stupid law in the world. Maybe made by someone, who doesn't really understand how the web works. 

Italy Cookie Choices allows you to easily comply with the european cookie law (and Italian too), showing a notice to the user only the very first time he visits your website.
Message, position and the style can be easily modified through the plugin menu.

The plugin will not add any CSS stylesheet or Javascript file but only inline script, so it doesn't make your website slower.

Now you can block all cookies with new Third Part Cookie Eraser, activated it and let me now if you have any issue

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How does it work? ###

When a user visit your site, the plugin will check if this user has been already there, checking for a cookie that the plugin self creates (it is just a session cookie, so it is not against the law). If the user has not this cookie, a message will be shown (you can configure where, how and what will be show). If the users keeps surfing in your website, now or withing the next month, it means that he accepted the use of cookies in your website, so this message
will not be shown again.

### Why am I not seeing the message? ###

Probably, you already have visited the site before, so you accepted the use of cookies and the plugin installed a cookie in your browser to know it. If you want to test if the plugin is working properly, try removing the cookies `displayCookieConsent` from your web browser or navigating in incognito mode. If you think that the plugin is not working properly, just open an issue here https://github.com/overclokk/italy-cookie-choices/issues and I will check it for you.

### Does it work in static HTML pages? ###

Yes, simply copy the snippet generate by "Italy Cookie Choses for WordPress" and put in your HTML footer before </body> tag

### I use Async JS and CSS plugin, but the banner doesn't display ###

You have to uncheck the `Detect <script> tags in wp_footer` in Async JS and CSS plugin settings page and refresh page.

### I don't see the banner in my site ###

Try this way:
deactivate all plugin and try
if it works activate one pluigin at time and try
if it doesn't work activate standard theme and try
